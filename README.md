This project is a TSRTC General Bus Pass Application Form created using pure HTML. It demonstrates key HTML form attributes like action, method, type, required, and select. The form captures full user details with input fields, radio buttons, and dropdowns. It reflects my ability to design real-world forms using clean HTML structure.
